On Monday, I decided to virtually attend a meeting with SeattleJS Hackers on React Hooks. I discovered the group through resources provided by Flatiron School to their alumni. This was incredibly helpful, as it really allowed me to get a better understanding of how React's useState and useEffect hooks work.

However, the meeting did not delve into the top if custom React hooks. As these are what I really wanted to know about, I too it upon myself to find a tutorial on YouTube about the subject. The tutorial I discovered was Codevolution, and the video that I started with can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yp6T-hF5ZY

Although, I had read through React's docs on creating custom hooks, these videos really helped me begin to grasp them. For whatever reason, it finally clicked in my head that custom hooks are basically just reusable functions that you can import into other parts of your React project. 

Thanks to both the SeattleJS Hackers group and the YouTube tutorials, I realized that I should have used a useEffect hook instead of useState hook in the app using an IMDB api that I tried to make last week.
