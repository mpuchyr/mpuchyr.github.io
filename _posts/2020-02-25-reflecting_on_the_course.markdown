It's hard to believe that my coding education with FlatIron School is coming to an end. Back when I started in September, February seemed so far away. Now that my final project has been completed, it feels like it went by so quickly. 

The first part of the course, basic Ruby, was relatively easy for me. It was with the syntax change introduced in Ruby on Rails that things got harder. That pattern would persist throughout each subject of the course. It was mentioned that you only got the section down *after* finishing that section's project. Those words couldn't have been more true for me. It always felt to me like "okay, I get this" while coding the final project of each section.

Another pattern that persisted was working on the projects. There would be one or two false starts where I scrapped everything and started over. However, I would generally get the minimum viable product (i.e. meeting the project's basic requirements) done by the Wednesday of a given project week. The rest of the week would be spent adding onto, tweaking, and styling the project. 

I got through it all with persistence, help from instructors and fellow students, and a number of epiphanies after metaphorically slamming my head into a brick wall. It was definitely quite a challenge at times, with a number of late nights devoted to code. 

Now it's time to move on and put my newfound skills to the test.
