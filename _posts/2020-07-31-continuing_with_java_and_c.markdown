This past week I've continued relearning Java and C++. For writing Java, I've recently switched over to using the Intellij integrated development environment (IDE). It has a handy template for creating command line Java projects. What finally got me to use Intellij was finding a Java course on Udemy that I wanted to follow along with.

Intellij is free, and can currently be found here:

For writing C++, I've been using Visual Studio Code. For compiling C++, I've been using the Developer Command Prompt including with Microsoft's Visual Studio.
