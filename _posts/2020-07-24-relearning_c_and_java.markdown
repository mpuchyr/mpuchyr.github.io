Over the past week, after scrolling through a multitude of job postings online, I thought I'd look into C++ and Java. This came about because a number of listings similar to what I was looking for (front end web developer) listed Java as one of the qualifications. A few times, if I'm remembering correctly, I also came across C++.

I figured that I might possibly be able to expand my opportunities by having at least a familiarity with those particular programming languages. I have had experience with both C++ and Java before, quite awhile ago in community college and high school, respectively. Java didn't really feel familiar at all, even though I know I've used it before. C++, on the other hand, felt a little more familar. I still remember all of the times typing the command 'cout' in programs in high school.

That being said, the concepts are definitely recognizable. I believe this would hold true no matter what programming language is used. After all, when you get right down to it, they're all trying to accomplish the same task in an albeit slight different manner: telling a computer what to do.
